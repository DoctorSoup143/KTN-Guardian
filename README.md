## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### ▶️ When does KTN Guardian start recording?

KTN Guardian only starts recording **after you log in** and click the **Start** button. It won’t monitor or record anything before that point.

---

### 💻 Do I need to install KTN Guardian?

Nope. KTN Guardian is **portable**—there’s no installation required. You can delete the program after each tournament if you'd like. It’s that lightweight.

---

### 📋 What does KTN Guardian record?

KTN Guardian randomly collects the following data at various intervals while it's active:

- **Process Info**: Names, unique IDs, start times  
- **Resource Usage**: CPU usage, memory allocation, peak memory, virtual memory, working set sizes  
- **Process Metadata**: Priority levels, handle counts  
- **Screenshots**: Captures **all monitors** during operation

All of this data is used to verify gameplay legitimacy and catch potential cheating activity.

---

### 🧾 Does it record anything else?

No. KTN Guardian only records what's listed above.  
No personal files, browser history, passwords, or unrelated system activity is monitored or accessed. That's illegal.

---

### ⬆️ How is the data uploaded?

When you press **Stop** (or close the app), a ZIP archive containing your log data is generated and uploaded to KTN’s secure server, linked directly to your KTN tournament account.

> ⚠️ **Do not interrupt this upload** — it could result in **disqualification**.

---

### 📁 Can I see the data being uploaded?

Yes! The ZIP file is created locally in the same directory where the app is located. You can inspect the contents yourself.

> 🔐 Any attempts to alter this file will be detected and lead to **immediate disqualification**.

---

### 🧹 Are previous logs saved?

No. The **last ZIP report is deleted** automatically when you press the Start button again. This ensures only current session data is retained.

---

### ❌ What if the upload fails?

If you encounter an error **after pressing Stop or closing the app**, **do not press Start again**.  
Instead, contact KTN support in a Discord support ticket before taking any further action.

---

### 🤝 Will my data be shared with anyone else?

No. Your data is **never** shared outside the official KTN staff team.  
We treat all recorded data as strictly confidential.

---

### 🔐 Why does KTN Guardian need admin (elevated) permissions?

KTN Guardian needs elevated access to:

- Monitor system-level processes  
- Collect accurate resource usage data  
- Capture display screenshots across all monitors  

Without these permissions, KTN Guardian cannot perform its anti-cheat functions effectively.

---

### 🔐 Do I have to log in to use it?

Yes. KTN Guardian syncs with your KTN website profile to ensure your data is linked securely and accurately to your tournament identity.

---

### 💡 Why was KTN Guardian created?

KTN Guardian was built to:

- Ensure tournament winners are legitimate  
- Monitor gameplay conditions fairly  
- Detect cheating effectively  
- Maintain integrity and trust in KTN-hosted events
